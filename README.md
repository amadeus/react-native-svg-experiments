# React Native SVG Tests

This repo is being used to experiment with using
[react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg)

Mostly I want to find out how feasible it would be to use the power of SVG
masks in a React Native environment to help the iOS achieve design parity with
desktop.

## Dev Instructions

```
yarn
yarn start
```
